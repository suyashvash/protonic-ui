# Protonic UI

Platform - iOS + Android 

### About- 

This UI Kit provides beautiful styled UI Elements for react native. Our target is to provide special and manually crafted UI Elements which come in daily use for devs but either they are not good as they should be or are not available in react-native. We target to make all these elements without using any other lib or module and keep the dev dependencies as low as possible.


## Installation

```cd
npm i protonic-ui
```

## How to use

> I am working on a proper documentation site/ web app. If you think you can give it a hand, That would be so great!

Import the elements using 

```js
import { FlatButton } from "protonic-ui";

```

Then in your render method

```js
<FlatButton onPress={()=>alert("Damnn bro !")} />
```
